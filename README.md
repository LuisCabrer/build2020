## Using AI to mine unstructured research papers to fight COVID-19 
Speaker: Liam Cavanagh

There is an overwhelming amount of information (and misinformation) about COVID-19.  How can we use AI to better understand this disease?  In this session, we take an open dataset of research papers on COVID-19 and apply several machine learning techniques (name entity recognition of medical terms, finding semantically similar words, contextual summarization, and knowledge graphs) which can help first responders and medical professionals better find and make sense of the research they need.  We will dive into the techniques used and share code samples, so developers will walk away with the understanding of how to build a similar solution using Cognitive Search. 
 
## Azure Cognitive Search: Deep Dive with AI Debug Sessions

Building skillsets and AI enrichment pipelines can be complex. Finding issues and debugging skillsets can be even more complex. In this session, you’ll learn about a new feature in Azure Cognitive Search that allows you to simulate a full IDE-like debug environment for working with cognitive skills. With features like expression evaluators, skills execution graph, and request tracing, you will be able to not just resolve errors in your skillset, but iteratively build complex skillsets and bring the full power of cognitive skills to your content.
 
## Active Learning with Azure Cognitive Search 
Speaker: Vinod Kurpad

When working with a large corpus of data, we often start with an intuition on the latent insights. Azure Cognitive Search has all the tools needed for you to start with just that intuition to build an active learning pipeline. In this session, you will learn how to apply this active learning pattern to the entity extraction task. Knowing a few entities contained in the corpus is all you need to very quickly build a multi-pass enrichment pipeline. The pattern walks you through generating training data to train a model, and integrates the model trained in Azure Machine Learning back into your enrichment pipeline as a new Azure Machine Learning skill.
 
## Azure Cognitive Search: What’s new in security 

Speaker: Mike Carter

Azure Cognitive Search is evolving to meet the strict security requirements of enterprise and government customers. You need your data protected both at rest and in transit without having to be a security expert. In this session, you’ll learn about how our latest improvements to encryption at rest, VNet integration, firewall with IP restrictions, and compliance help you build a great search experience without putting your data at risk.
